Build a Breakout Game: Project Plan

One interesting variant of the Breakout game that I thought was interesting
was the Worm version. In this version there were a numerous amount of powerups 
that fell from the blocks. Essentially the way the game was structured it relied
heavily on those powerups to move onto the next level. Another variant I thought
was interesting was the Warloads version. I liked this one because of the concept
of breaking the blocks in order to get to some goal or target. I think I will try 
to incorporate this aspect into my own breakout game.
